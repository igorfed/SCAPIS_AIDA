## Overview
This is a research environment tool which is simplified user-level for prepare large amount of medical data to train, run and generate annonimized medical images using well known
[Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans). <br>
It is implemented ib **Python** and has operating system independent layer that allows it to run, potentially, on any OS.<br>
**The main solving tasks:**<br>
* Establish a generic and efficient console platform with possibility to run in Linux terminal to prepare, analyse and generate image data from SCAPIS (and others selected datasets);<br>
* Provide a basic knowledge of medical images, load convert and process them to train anonymized images;<br>
* The work package includes the source datasets processing which meets the requirenments for use on SCAPIS data and implemnent aftewards the metod in robust engine in SCAPISE AI platform.<br>
