SCAPIS AIDA is the research environment tool with help to prepare large amount of medical data to train, run and generate annonimized medical images using  Generative Adversarial Networks.<br>
The main solving task:<br>
* Establish a generic and work-efficient console platform to prepare, analyse and generate image data from SCAPIS (and others selected datasets)
* Provide a basic knowledge of medical images and load and process them to train GAN
* The work package includes the source datasets processing which meets the requirenments for use on SCAPIS data and implemnent aftewards the metod in robust engine in SCAPISE AI platform.


#Installing / Getting started

## System 
##Create an Environment 
```
conda create --name SCAPIS_AIDA python=3.6
conda info --envs
conda activate ./SCAPIS_AIDA
```
After activating an environment using its prefix, the prompt will look similar to the following:
