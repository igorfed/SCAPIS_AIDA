## Overview

This is a research environment tool which is simplified user-level for prepare large amount of medical data to train, run and generate anonymized medical images using well known
[Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans). </br>
It is implemented in **Python3** and has an independent layer that allows it to run, potentially, on any OS.</br>
**The main solving tasks:**</br>
*Establish a generic and efficient console platform with possibility to run in Linux terminal to prepare, analyze and generate image data from SCAPIS (and others selected datasets);</br>
*Provide a basic knowledge of medical images, load convert and process them to train anonymized images;</br>
*The work package includes the source datasets processing which meets the requirements for use on SCAPIS data and implement afterwards the method in robust engine in SCAPIS AI platform.</br>
