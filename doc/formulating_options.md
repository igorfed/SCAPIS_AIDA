## Delimitations

The functionality for generating synthetic data assumes there is already a trained GAN forthe dataset of interest.  For now It is considered out of scope to also consider using the application for training.

1. The next step of the tool to make a fetch the data set and run through anonymized 2D module.
2. Add pretrained PCGAN with generation of synthetic 3D data. 
3. Visualize metric of generated 2D images (needs to be confirmed by all authors)
4. Test the tool under the DGX-2
